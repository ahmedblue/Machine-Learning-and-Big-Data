# Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data
This is going to document projects involving machine learning and big data especially around the financial sector. 

It will include a project regarding the creation of a mordern ATM, the technical requirements. 

The other project will be centered around a machine learning algorithim to predict the buyers of a certain product. 

Below is an overview of the different projects: 

Project 1: 

Hyper Big Banks new projectaims to be a technology-driven next-generation bank which conducts all its operations from the vicinity of the automated teller machine and movile app. The report shows the technical requirements and explores the use of technological products such as Azure and GCP.
In order to enhance and achieve the target. It shows the potential for growth HyperOne has considering the number of unbanked people in these countries. It explores the rationale behind the suggestion we made for strategic locations such as India, Nigeria and Brazil. We also analyze the impact that HyperOne can have on the financial markets in emerging countries and worldwide as a whole.

Project 2: 

This report looks in detail at the making of a predictive model which can be used to predict which customers of Hyper Bank are likely to invest in Hyper Crypto. The report investigates how and why we came to choose a Decision Tree Model over the others. We look at further details on how to enhance the process of identifying potential clients. We also show the features which have the most correlation of determining whether one would be potentially interested in Hyper Crypto along with the features that are redundant and play little to no role in the selection. Furthermore, this report highlights ways to improve the process of identifying the potential clients and the data required.
